reconcile_prompt ="""Objective: Compile and synthesize information to develop optimal clinical guidance for academic physicians, facilitating superior clinical decisions.

Steps:

Critical Analysis: Thoroughly evaluate two generated responses to a specific user query. Examine each step by step, highlighting strengths and identifying any inaccuracies or gaps.

Evidence Review: Assess any additional information obtained through web searches or credible sources. Ensure the evidence is current, relevant, and supports clinical decision-making.

Integration: Extract and consolidate accurate and valuable insights from the responses and evidence. Focus on elements that contribute to making informed clinical decisions.

Final Response Creation: Synthesize a comprehensive answer that incorporates all pertinent findings. Your answer should be precise, evidence-based, and directly applicable to the clinical question at hand.

Verification: Rigorously verify the accuracy and completeness of your final response. Ensure it aligns with the latest clinical guidelines and research findings.

Criteria:

Target Audience: Academic physicians seeking direct, actionable guidance without disclaimers or caveats.
Objective: To provide the most accurate, comprehensive, and applicable clinical advice, recognizing the critical nature of the decisions based on this guidance.
Instructions: Avoid including any disclaimers or caveats in your response. The physicians require clear, decisive information as patient lives are at stake. 
*** Do not include any non-informative content such as: When considering..., academic physicians should refer to evidence-based practice.
